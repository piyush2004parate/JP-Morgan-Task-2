# JP-Morgan-Task-2

A Python implementation for "JP Morgan Task 2" — a coding/data-processing challenge.  
This repository contains the solution code, tests, and supporting files for the task. If anything below doesn't match the files in the repo (script names, folders, etc.), update the commands to point to the correct file paths.

## Project Overview
This repository contains a solution for JP-Morgan-Task-2. The code is written in Python and implements the required functionality for the task (data processing, model, or algorithm — adjust this section to reflect the actual task). The README provides steps to set up the environment, run the code, and run tests.

## Features
- Clear, modular Python code
- Unit tests (pytest)
- Requirements file for reproducible environment
- Example usage instructions

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.8+
- pip for dependency management
- pytest for tests

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer
- git
- (Optional) virtualenv or venv

### Installation
Clone the repository and create a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/piyush2004parate/JP-Morgan-Task-2.git
cd JP-Morgan-Task-2
python -m venv venv
# On macOS / Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows (PowerShell):
# .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If no `requirements.txt` exists, install dependencies manually as needed (for example, pytest for tests):
```bash
pip install pytest
```

### Running the project
Replace `ENTRY_POINT` with the correct script/module for this repository (e.g., `main.py`, `app.py`, or `src/main.py`).

Run from the project root:
```bash
# Example: run a main script
python ENTRY_POINT.py

# Or run as a module if the code is packaged:
python -m package_name.module
```

If the repository contains Jupyter notebooks, open them with:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

If the repository requires input data:
- Place data files in a `data/` directory (create if missing).
- Update configuration or constants in the code to point to the correct data paths.

## Project Structure
This is a suggested structure — adapt if the repo differs:

- README.md                    # this file
- requirements.txt             # project dependencies
- src/                         # source code
  - main.py                    # entry point (example)
  - module1.py                 # example modules
- notebooks/                   # Jupyter notebooks (if any)
- data/                        # input / output data (gitignored typically)
- tests/                       # unit tests
- .gitignore

Update this section to reflect the actual structure in this repository.

## Running Tests
If tests are provided and use pytest:
```bash
# from repo root
pytest -q
```

Add or run specific tests:
```bash
pytest tests/test_example.py::test_some_function -q
```

## Development notes
- Use linters (flake8, pylint) and formatters (black) to maintain code quality.
- Add type hints for better maintainability.
- If the code needs configuration, prefer environment variables or a config file (e.g., `.env`, `config.yml`).
